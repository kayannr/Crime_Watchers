# Project 1 - Crime Watchers - New York

The purpose of this task is to perform a crime analysis for the city of New York using the data obtained from various online sources. The data used for this analysis is limited to 8 types of crimes and excludes others. Initially, a hypothesis was created, which states that if the shelter-in-place protocol was implemented, then the result would be an overall decline in crimes committed. Overall, there has been a slight increase in major crimes reported in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic, which contradicts the hypothesis.
